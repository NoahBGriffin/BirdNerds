# BirdNerds
Full-Stack bird tracking application built together with Rebecca Palmore, Ashley Hoffman, and Amy Pfaff for the final capstone project at Tech Elevator's Java coding bootcamp.

Built using Java, PostgreSQL, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue. This program allows users to track birds they spot in various locations. It also allows users, both anonymous and logged in, to view birds that have been spotted in a specific zipcode. This project was completed over a two week period using agile methodology.


### Future Patch Notes
1. Implement cloudinary widget to allow users to upload bird images
2. Make mobile responsive
3. Fix nav items to minimize when a different item is clicked
